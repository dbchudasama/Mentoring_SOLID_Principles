# Single_Responsibility_Principle
Project for practicing Single Responsibilty from SOLID Software Engineering Principles. First in series of Mentoring for Vaishali and Maryam - 1st Year CS students at UoL.

Single responsibility is the concept of a Class doing one specific thing (responsibility) and only that and not trying to do more than it should.

Exercise:

Demonstrate Single Responsibility for a class 'Person' with the following properties:
  - name 
  - surname
  - email

and the following two method signatures:
  - greet(){}
  - validateEmail(email: string){}

HINT: You can define more than one class to help you achieve this. Think about what properties/method given above can belong to multiple classes or in it's own class.
