# Open_Close_Principle
Project for practicing Open/Close from SOLID Software Engineering Principles. Second in series of Mentoring for Vaishali and Maryam - 1st Year CS students at UoL.

Open/Close is the concept of writing your code so that you will be able to add new functionality without changing the existing code. This prevents situations in which a change to one of your classes also requires you to adapt all depending classes. 

Exercise:

Continuing from our previous example, demonstrate Open/Close for a class 'Person' with the following properties:
  - name 
  - surname
  - email

However, this time we require the greet function to take an argument of the user's email and validate a list of email addresses like:
  - greet(email: string){}
  - validateEmail(email: ArrayList<string>){}
  
 Modify your previous solution to satisfy the above conditions. 

You can clone the repo locally, modify and push your changes to it as you progress. Please first create a new folder named with your name i.e. Vaishali or Maryam and then put all your code files in there so we know who has coded what :).


HINT: Consider using Interfaces.
